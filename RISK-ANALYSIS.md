## üß© Introduction

The module protects outbound connections by enforcing strict mutual TLS (mTLS) when creating `HttpClient` instances. It loads client certificates from PFX or Windows Certificate Store, validates server certificates against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), checks validity periods and trust chains, and blocks connections if validation fails.

This ensures that client applications only connect to authorized servers, maintaining Zero Trust principles for critical municipal and infrastructure systems.
